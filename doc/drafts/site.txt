ClickHouse is free analytical DBMS for big data.

ClickHouse powers Yandex.Metrica - second largest web analytics system in the world.
In Yandex.Metrica, all incoming data is ingested into ClickHouse in realtime (about 20 billion events each day).
Currently, Yandex.Metrica has more than 13 trillion records in ClickHouse powered database.
It is used for fully customizable reports, that are generated on-the-fly, directly from non-aggregated data.
Yandex.Metrica allows customers to slice and dice data in every detail, even for huge traffic sites, with instant results.

ClickHouse is the only open-source system, that is capable of doing such kind of things.


Big Data


Linearly scalable

ClickHouse allows to add servers to cluster when necessary.
For example, in Yandex.Metrica, main cluster has grown from 60 to 394 servers in two years.
Servers are placed in six different geographically distributed datacenters.

ClickHouse is using maximum of available hardware to process queries as fast as possible.
We achieve peak performance of more than 2 terabytes per second for single query (data after decompression, only used columns).

ClickHouse scales well both vertically and horizontally.
We have installations with more than two trillion rows per single node, and another installations with 100 TB of storage per single node.


Efficient use of hardware

ClickHouse is column-oriented DBMS. It works 2-3 orders of magnitude faster on typical analytical queries with same available IO throughput, comparable to traditional row-oriented systems. Due to columnar format, more hot data fits in RAM, that leads to even faster response times.
ClickHouse is space and time efficient. All data is stored compressed. Compression works surprisingly good, thanks to column store.

ClickHouse constantly maintains data locality for loaded data. It minimizes number of seeks for range queries, so ClickHouse works fine on cheap rotational drives.
ClickHouse is also CPU efficient due to vectorized query execution, runtime code generation and top notch implementations of core algorithms.

For most types of queries, ClickHouse doesn't require fast network, because it minimizes data transfers. Distributed queries will work even in multi-datacenter environment.


Fast

We proud of high performance of ClickHouse. Throughput of query processing per single server is usually from hundreds millions to more than billion rows per second and to more than tens of gigabytes per second. It's hard to believe that is possible to process data in such high rates. But you don't need to beleive, because ClickHouse is actually do that.

On our performance testing, ClickHouse works few times faster than best of available commercial column-oriented DBMS.


Fault tolerance


Feature rich


Simple and handy

ClickHouse works not only on hundred node clusters. It could be installed on single server or even virtual machine, and that installation is practical. You could test ClickHouse even on Linux laptop. At Yandex, there are many cases, when analysts with no development experience have installed ClickHouse and create data viewers on top of it.
Many people start using ClickHouse, because it is simple and works out of the box.


High reliable

Reliability never comes for free. It is always consequence of long term production usage.
At Yandex, ClickHouse is used in production since 2012 with no significant issues.
