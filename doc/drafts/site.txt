ClickHouse is free analytic DBMS for big data.


ClickHouse is capable of serving extremely large volumes of data in a stable and sustainable manner. It currently powers Yandex.Metrica, world’s second largest web analytics platform, with over 13 trillion database records and over 20 billion events a day, generating customized reports on-the-fly, directly from non-aggregated data.


Linearly scalable

ClickHouse allows companies to add servers to their clusters when necessary without investing time or money into additional DBMS modification. The system continued to successfully serve Yandex.Metrica, whose servers, located in six geographically distributed datacenters, have grown from 60 to 394 in its main cluster in two years.

ClickHouse scales well both vertically and horizontally.
We have installations with more than two trillion rows per single node, and another installations with 100 TB of storage per single node.

ClickHouse is easily adaptable to perform both on hundreds of node clusters, and on a single server or even virtual machine.


Hardware-efficient

ClickHouse works 2-3 orders of magnitude faster on typical analytical queries with same available IO throughput, comparable to traditional row-oriented systems. Due to columnar format, more hot data fits in RAM, that leads to even faster response times.
ClickHouse is space and time efficient. All data is stored compressed. Compression works surprisingly good, thanks to column store.

ClickHouse maintains locality of reference for stored data continually, which minimizes number of seeks for range queries and increases efficiency of using rotational drives.

Due to vectorized query execution, runtime code generation and top-notch implementation of its core algorithms, ClickHouse is CPU efficient.

For most types of queries, ClickHouse doesn't require fast network, because it minimizes data transfers. Distributed queries will work even in multi-datacenter environment.


Fast

ClickHouse’s capacity has been proven to process hundreds of millions to more than a billion rows and tens of gigabytes of data per single server per second. On our performance testing, ClickHouse works few times faster than best of available commercial column-oriented DBMS.

ClickHouse uses all available hardware to its full potential to process each query as fast as possible. The peak processing performance for a single query (after decompression, only used columns) stands at more than 2 terabytes per second.


Fault-tolerant

ClickHouse supports multi-master asynchronous replication. It could span through multiple datacenters.
Single nodes and even datacenter downtime doesn't affect the availability of system for reads and writes.
Distributed reads are automatically balanced to alive replicas without increase of latency.
After nodes downtime, replicated data is synchronized automatically or semi-automatically.


Feature rich

ClickHouse has many builtin features especially useful for web-analytics. It has probablistic data structures for fast and memory-efficient calculation of cardinalities and quantiles. It offers highly optimized functions for URL and IP-address processing (both IPv4 and IPv6) as well as providing rich possibilities for date and time processing, including time zones. Data management methods, such as arrays, nested data structures and ARRAY JOINs, available in ClickHouse can be used for management of denormalized data.

ClickHouse supports both local and distributed JOINs. Local JOINs are optimal when joined data is co-located on same nodes.
ClickHouse has natural support for (optional) approximate query processing - you could get the result of query as fast as you want.

Using ClickHouse’s conditional aggregate functions, calculation of totals and extremes, you can get results with a single query instead of having to run a number of those.

One of unusually powerful features of ClickHouse are external dictionaries - dimension tables that is loaded from external source and is used in queries for seamless JOINs in most optimal way.


Simple and handy

ClickHouse is simple and works out-of-the-box. As well as performing on hundreds of node clusters, this system can be easily installed on a single server or even a virtual machine. At Yandex, there are many cases, when analysts with no development experience have installed ClickHouse and create data viewers on top of it.


High reliable

At Yandex, Russia’s leading search provider, ClickHouse is used in production since 2012 across a range of products and services with a large number of high load data points, including Metrica, Market, Mail and Ads.

ClickHouse is purely distributed system located on independent nodes with no single point of failure.
When using replication, it (optionally) relies on ZooKeeper for coordination. Even in case of ZooKeeper failure, system is available for read requests. Even if all metadata in ZooKeeper is corrupted, you don't lose your data.

In case of software or hardware failures, or misconfuguration, ClickHouse never deletes "broken" data. Instead, it will move broken data to safe place or ask you what to do before node startup. It is rather difficult to accidentially corrupt or lose your data. All data is checksummed before every read or write to disk or network. It is virtually impossible to delete the whole data by accident.

ClickHouse offers flexible limits on query complexity and resource usage, which can be fine-tuned using settings. It is possible to simultaneously serve both a number of high priority low-latency requests and some long-running queries with lowered priority.


Opens new possibilities

ClickHouse simplifies all your data processing. All you have to do is ingest all your structured data into the system without any pre-aggregation, and it is instantly available for reports. New columns for new properties and dimensions can be easily added to the system at any time without slowing it down.

ClickHouse works two-three orders of magnitude faster than traditional map-reduce based approaches. It is not just quantitative improvement. When using traditional approaches, you have "data lake" with all data available for any queries, but very slowly and not handy: even simple queries run for minutes or hours. By contrast, in ClickHouse, you get instant results in subsecond to few seconds time in usual cases: data is processed faster than you write the query. And you quickly come with possibility to run more analytical queries, to test more hypothesis, to further slice and dice data, to look at data from more dimensions: it is like as you just started to think faster.
